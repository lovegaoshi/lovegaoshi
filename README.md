### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I mainly develop on mobile/react-native, but I also build desktop stuff. Check out my apps! Let's connect!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- [AzusaPlayerMobile](https://github.com/lovegaoshi/azusa-player-mobile): A mobile YTMusic like experience built for Bilibili. Feature rich and built with react-native to support both android and ios with one single code base. 
- [NoxPlayer](https://github.com/lovegaoshi/azusa-player): A desktop YTMusic like experience built for Bilibili. Submodules APM to reuse all of its fetch and data management logic. Available in chrome/edge extension extension store, seamlessly integrates with your Bilibili browsing experience.
-  [Inaseg](https://github.com/lovegaoshi/ipynb): A python script wrapping yt-dlp, ffmpeg, [InaSpeechSegmenter](https://github.com/ina-foss/inaSpeechSegmenter), [shazamapi](https://pypi.org/project/ShazamAPI/) and [biliup-rs](https://github.com/biliup/biliup-rs) that autonomously downloads, segments, identifies and uploads karaoke streams to the Bilibili platform. 
- [react-native-track-player](https://github.com/lovegaoshi/react-native-track-player): The most feature rich audio playback library the RN community offers. Forked out of upstream as its development went under a hiatus, RNTP is the only react native audio library that integrates with Android auto, supports crossfade and fading effects, audiofx and visualizer. Starts headlessly with other controllers.
