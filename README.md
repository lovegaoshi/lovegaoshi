### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Currently devoted to music segmentation and VTuber singers. AIMP is the best music player app. Lets connect!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- [AzusaPlayerMobile](https://github.com/lovegaoshi/azusa-player-mobile): The YTMusic of Bilibili in the style of AIMP with VTuber sprinkles. Works like wonders.
- [NoxPlayer](https://github.com/lovegaoshi/azusa-player): The YTMusic of Bilibili but in the form of a chrome extension. A forked project of [azusa-player](https://github.com/kenmingwang/azusa-player) with feature enhancements.
-  [Inaseg](https://github.com/lovegaoshi/ipynb): A python script wrapping yt-dlp, ffmpeg, [InaSpeechSegmenter](https://github.com/ina-foss/inaSpeechSegmenter), [shazamapi](https://pypi.org/project/ShazamAPI/) and [biliup-rs](https://github.com/biliup/biliup-rs) that achieved fully autonomous music segmentation, recognization and upload of any music streams. In particular, VTuber singer livestreams. Works like wonders, would highly recommend.
